## 1. Problem Statement & Vision

### 🔴 The Gap

India's sports ecosystem has a fundamental discovery problem. The country of 1.4 billion people — many of them athletically gifted — runs its talent identification almost exclusively through:

- **Physical scouting camps** concentrated in urban centers
- **Recommendations from coaches** that require geographic proximity
- **Bandwidth-heavy assessments** dependent on travel and infrastructure

The result? A vast reservoir of talent from **rural, semi-urban, and remote regions goes completely undetected** — not because the ability isn't there, but because the assessment infrastructure isn't there.

A talented powerlifter training in a gym in Bastar, a calisthenics prodigy doing pull-ups on a bar in a village in Manipur, a teenage athlete in Bihar who has never been near a scouting camp — all of these athletes are **invisible to the national sports system** simply because of geography.

### ✅ The Vision

**ATHLETIX** is built on a single premise: *a smartphone camera is now capable of being a world-class scout.*

By combining pose estimation, sport-specific biomechanical analysis, and AI scoring — delivered through a simple mobile app — we give every athlete access to:

- An **objective, standardized** performance assessment
- Immediate, structured **feedback on their form and technique**
- Visibility on a **national leaderboard** ranked by genuine performance
- A pathway to be **discovered by sports officials and government scouts** without ever leaving their town

This platform directly serves the **Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports'** mandate to identify and nurture athletic talent from every corner of India — democratizing access to sports scouting in a way that no physical camp or regional event ever could.

> *"Talent is everywhere. Assessment is not. ATHLETIX changes that."*

## 2. What is ATHLETIX?

ATHLETIX is a **cross-platform mobile application** built with React Native (Expo) for athletes, coaches, and government sports officials. It is backed by a Python FastAPI server, a PostgreSQL database (via Supabase), Cloudinary video infrastructure, and a custom AI/Computer Vision pipeline powered by MediaPipe BlazePose.

### The Four-Step User Journey

```
1. PRIVATE PRACTICE          2. DELIBERATE SUBMISSION
   Athletes practice             Athlete submits only their best
   anytime, anywhere             attempt (video), anywhere,
   in a private, secure          from a private & secure space.

## 3. How It Works — The Core Loop

```
Athlete records their performance at home / gym / field
          |
          v
Selects sport (Powerlifting or Calisthenics) + specific exercise
          |
          v
Uploads MP4 video (1-2 minutes) via the ATHLETIX app
          |
          v
Backend receives upload
  --> saves to Cloudinary (compressed for low-bandwidth)
  --> video status: PENDING
          |
          v
AI Pipeline triggered asynchronously:
  [Frame Extraction]
  --> [MediaPipe BlazePose: Keypoint Detection]
  --> [Exercise-Specific Metric Extraction]
  --> [Scoring Engine: Score + Strengths + Weaknesses + Suggestions]
  --> Write to assessments table
  --> video status: COMPLETED
          |
          v
Athlete receives push notification: "Your AI Report is Ready"
          |
          v
Athlete views detailed report + sees leaderboard rank
          |
          v
Sports Official reviews high-scoring athletes
  --> Verifies performance authenticity
  --> Shortlists athletes for further selection
```

---

## 4. Target Users & Roles

ATHLETIX is a **role-based platform** with three distinct user types, each with dedicated dashboards and access controls enforced at the database level:

| Role | Who They Are | What They Can Do |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Athlete** | Any individual recording themselves performing a sport/exercise — from rural villages to city gyms | Sign up, select sport/exercise, upload video, receive AI report, view leaderboard rank, track performance history, receive notifications |
| **Sports / Govt Official** | Government-appointed scouts, sports authority representatives, coaches with official credentials | Review AI-assessed athlete profiles, watch videos, verify performance authenticity (adds a trust badge), shortlist athletes for further selection |
| **Admin** | Platform owner/operator | Full platform visibility: user management, video content oversight, flagged content review, platform-wide analytics |

### Role-Based Data Isolation (Row-Level Security)

Each role sees **only what they're supposed to see**, enforced at the database level by Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS):

- **Athletes** → only their own videos, reports, and notifications
- **Officials** → athlete profiles and reports; not other officials' shortlists
- **Admins** → full platform visibility across all records

---

## 5. Supported Sports & Exercises

ATHLETIX v1.0 ships with **2 sports** and **6 exercises** — chosen for the clearest pose-estimation signal and maximum demonstrability:

### Powerlifting — Form & Technique Scoring

| Exercise | What AI Evaluates |
|----------|------------------|
| **Squat** | Hip crease depth vs. knee, knee tracking over toes, torso angle, lockout at top |
| **Bench Press** | Bar path linearity, elbow angle, arch consistency, lockout quality |
| **Deadlift** | Hip hinge mechanics, spine neutrality, bar path, lockout position |

### Calisthenics — Form Scoring + Rep Counting

| Exercise | What AI Evaluates |
|----------|------------------|
| **Push-ups** | Elbow angle at bottom (ROM), body alignment (plank position), lockout at top, rep count |
| **Pull-ups** | Chin-over-bar standard, elbow extension at bottom, body swing, rep count |
| **Handstand** | Hold duration, balance quality (shoulder-over-wrist alignment), body line straightness |

> **Design Decision:** Athletes manually select their sport and exercise. Auto-detection of exercise type is deliberately out of scope for v1 — explicit selection ensures accurate pipeline routing and avoids misclassification false negatives in a demo environment.

---

## 6. Feature Set

### 6.1 Authentication

- **Role-based signup and login** (Athlete / Official / Admin)
- Powered by **Supabase Auth** with JWT tokens
- Role assigned at signup, embedded in JWT, enforced on both frontend route guards and backend middleware
- Secure token refresh; no credentials stored client-side beyond the auth token

### 6.2 Role-Specific Dashboards

**Athlete Dashboard:**
- Overview of past AI reports and scores
- Current leaderboard position per sport/exercise
- Verification badge status (if verified by an official)
- Notification center (report ready, shortlisted, verified)

**Official Dashboard:**
- Browse AI-assessed athletes filterable by sport, exercise, and score
- View individual AI reports + embedded video playback
- One-click **Verify** → adds verification badge to athlete profile
- One-click **Shortlist** → adds athlete to official's shortlist

**Admin Dashboard:**
- Platform-wide analytics: total signups, videos analyzed, avg. time-to-report, total shortlists
- User management: view and manage athletes and officials
- Content oversight: review uploaded videos, flag inappropriate content

### 6.3 Video Upload (Athlete-Controlled Submission)

- **Pre-recorded video upload only** — athlete decides what to submit, on their terms
- Format: **MP4 only** (validated client-side before upload)
- Duration: **1–2 minutes** (validated pre-upload)
- Uploaded to **Cloudinary** with automatic compression for rural/low-bandwidth delivery
- Upload status tracked: `pending` → `processing` → `completed` / `failed`
- Async upload UX: athlete is not blocked waiting; they are notified when the report is ready

> **Privacy Design:** The athlete controls exactly what they submit. Nothing is recorded automatically. This builds trust — particularly important for communities with lower digital literacy.

### 6.4 AI Video Analysis

Full pipeline: **Computer Vision + Pose Estimation → Metric Extraction → Scoring Engine → Structured Report**

For each video, the AI produces:
- **Score** (0–100 numerical scale)
- **Strengths** (what the athlete does well)
- **Weaknesses** (identified form errors)
- **Suggestions** (specific, actionable improvement notes)
- **Rep Count** (for calisthenics exercises)

### 6.5 Leaderboard (Contest-Style, AI-Score Driven)

- Ranks athletes **purely by their AI score**, per sport/exercise
- Fair and unbiased — score is objective, derived from biomechanical analysis
- **Verification badge**: a tick mark visible on an athlete's profile when a sports official manually verifies their performance. This is a **trust signal**, not a ranking factor — the leaderboard rank is AI-driven only.

### 6.6 Notifications (Push + In-App)

Triggered for:
- AI report is ready
- Official has verified performance
- Athlete has been shortlisted by an official
- New athlete submission available for review (official-side)

Powered by **Expo Push Notifications** + **FastAPI background tasks**.

### 6.7 Real-Time Form Guidance (Pre-Submission)

- Athletes receive live feedback on form, posture, and technique before finalizing a submission
- Encourages multiple practice attempts, improves overall quality of data entering the AI pipeline

                    |  Supabase       | |  Cloudinary            |

                    +-----------------+ +------------------------+
```

**Flow summary:** The mobile app talks only to FastAPI over HTTPS REST. FastAPI handles auth verification (via Supabase), business logic, and triggers the AI pipeline on uploaded videos. Videos live in Cloudinary (optimized for low-bandwidth delivery); structured data (users, scores, leaderboard, verifications) lives in Supabase Postgres.

### 7.2 Architecture Decisions & Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Mobile-first (React Native / Expo) | The problem lives in rural India — smartphones are the primary computing device. Expo gives a single codebase for Android and iOS. |
| FastAPI backend (Python) | Same language as the AI/CV pipeline — no cross-language marshalling. Async support handles concurrent video processing. |
| Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS) | Relational schema is correct (leaderboard rankings need joins). Supabase bundles Auth + RLS out of the box. Free tier sufficient. |
| Cloudinary for video | Auto-compression and CDN delivery are non-negotiable for rural/low-bandwidth users. Handled in a single SDK call. |
| AI pipeline isolated in services/ai/ | The scoring logic is the platform's core IP. Isolating it means it can be extracted into a standalone microservice as load grows — without restructuring the backend. |
| No in-app video recording | Keeps app size small; respects athlete agency — they submit their best take on their terms. |

### 7.3 Data Flow

```
Mobile App (HTTPS REST)
    |
    v
FastAPI --> Supabase Auth verification (every request)
    |
    +-- Video Upload --> Cloudinary (store) + Supabase (metadata, status=pending)
    |
    +-- AI Trigger (async background task)
    |       |
    |       v
    |   Cloudinary: download video for processing
    |       |
    |       v
    |   MediaPipe BlazePose: frame-by-frame keypoint extraction
    |       |
    |       v
    |   Exercise-specific metric extractor
    |       |
    |       v
    |   Scoring engine --> score + strengths + weaknesses + suggestions
    |       |
    |       v
    |   Write to assessments table, update video status=completed
    |       |
    |       v
    |   Trigger push notification --> Athlete
    |
    +-- Leaderboard query --> Supabase (derived view, sorted by AI score)
```

## 8. AI Analysis Pipeline (Deep Dive)

The AI pipeline is the heart of ATHLETIX. It converts raw video into structured, actionable, sport-specific performance intelligence.

### 8.1 Pipeline Flow

```
Video Upload (MP4, 1-2 min)
       |
       v
Pre-validation
  - File type check (MP4 only — reject early, don't waste compute)
  - Duration check (1-2 min window)
  - Frame count sanity check (detect corrupted/blank videos)
       |
       v
Preprocessing
  - Frame extraction (sample at consistent FPS, e.g. 15 fps)
  - Resolution normalization (standardize for model input)
       |
       v
Pose Estimation — MediaPipe BlazePose
  - 33 body landmark keypoints (x, y, z, visibility) per frame
       |
       v
Exercise-Specific Metric Extraction
  Powerlifting:
    Squat        -- hip crease depth vs knee line, knee tracking,
                    torso angle at bottom, lockout quality at top
    Bench Press  -- bar path proxy (wrist trajectory), elbow angle
                    at bottom, arch consistency, lockout
    Deadlift     -- hip hinge angle, spine deviation from neutral,
                    bar path (wrist vs body), lockout position
  Calisthenics:
    Push-up      -- elbow angle at bottom (ROM), body plank line,
                    lockout at top, rep state machine (up/down count)
    Pull-up      -- chin-over-bar detection, elbow extension at bottom,
                    body swing penalty, rep state machine
    Handstand    -- shoulder-over-wrist alignment, body line
                    straightness, hold duration tracking
       |
       v
Scoring Engine
  - Rule-based component scoring per metric
  - Weighted aggregation --> overall score (0-100)
  - Strength detection (metrics above threshold)
  - Weakness detection (metrics below threshold)
  - Suggestion generation (templated, per weakness identified)
       |
       v
Write to DB
  - assessments table: score, strengths[], weaknesses[], suggestions[],
                       rep_count (calisthenics), created_at
  - videos table: status --> 'completed' (or 'failed' on error)
       |
       v
Push Notification --> Athlete ("Your AI Report is Ready")
```

### 8.2 Failure Handling in the AI Pipeline

| Failure Scenario | Handling |
|-----------------|---------|
| No person detected in video | Video status → `failed`; human-readable error returned |
| Video is corrupted or blank | Pre-validation catches before wasting compute; early rejection |
| Wrong exercise selected | Score reflects mismatch; athlete guided to re-submit |
| MediaPipe low-confidence keypoints | Low-confidence frames filtered out; graceful degradation on insufficient valid frames |
| Processing timeout | Background task timeout handler; video marked `failed`; athlete notified |

### 8.3 Error Response Shape

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VIDEO_PROCESSING_FAILED",
    "message": "Could not detect a person in the video. Please ensure your full body is visible in the frame."
  }
}
```

## 13. Build Roadmap — Phase by Phase

Phases are ordered by **dependency**, not fixed time — scales from a multi-week runway to a 36-hour hackathon crunch.

### Phase 0 — Setup & Foundations

- Initialize repo (frontend + backend as separate folders)
- Supabase project created: Postgres tables from schema, Auth enabled
- Cloudinary account configured, API keys obtained
- `.env` and `.gitignore` set up from commit #1 (secrets never committed)
- Expo project scaffolded with route group shell: `(auth)` / `(athlete)` / `(official)` / `(admin)`
- FastAPI project scaffolded per Architecture.md folder structure

**Exit Criteria:** Empty app boots on Android. Empty FastAPI server returns 200. Supabase DB is reachable.

---

### Phase 1 — Authentication

- Supabase Auth integration: signup and login endpoints
- Role assignment (Athlete / Official / Admin) at signup
- Role-based route protection: frontend guards + backend middleware
- Basic RLS policies applied in Supabase

**Exit Criteria:** All 3 roles can sign up, log in, and land on their role-specific (empty) dashboard.

---

### Phase 2 — Dashboard Skeletons

- Athlete Dashboard: empty state (no reports, leaderboard placeholder, notification bell)
- Official Dashboard: empty athlete list with filter UI shell
- Admin Dashboard: empty analytics view
- Shared navigation, layout components, design tokens

**Exit Criteria:** Each role sees a distinct, functional (but data-empty) dashboard after login.

---

### Phase 3 — Sport/Exercise Selection + Video Upload

- Sport/domain selection UI: Powerlifting (Squat/Bench/Deadlift), Calisthenics (Push-up/Pull-up/Handstand)
- Video file picker with client-side validation (MP4 only, 1-2 min)
- Upload to Cloudinary, save video metadata + status `pending` in Postgres
- Upload progress indicator; async UX (no blocking)

**Exit Criteria:** Athlete can select an exercise, upload a valid MP4, and see it listed as `pending`.

---

### Phase 4 — AI Analysis Pipeline *(Most Critical Phase)*

> Build end-to-end on **ONE exercise first** (recommended: Squat or Push-up — clearest keypoint signal), then replicate the pattern.

- Integrate MediaPipe BlazePose in Python — extract 33-keypoint coordinates per frame
- Build metric extractor for the pilot exercise
- Build scoring engine: 0-100 score + strengths + weaknesses + suggestions
- Write results to `assessments` table, update video status `processing` → `completed` / `failed`
- Display AI report on Athlete Dashboard

**Exit Criteria:** ONE full exercise works end-to-end: upload → AI processes → athlete sees a real score and feedback.

---

### Phase 5 — Expand AI Pipeline to Remaining Exercises

- Replicate Phase 4 pattern to all remaining 5 exercises
- Each exercise has its own metric extractor in `services/ai/exercises/`
- Calisthenics: rep counting state machine validated across push-up, pull-up, handstand
- Edge cases handled: no person detected, wrong exercise selected

**Exit Criteria:** All 6 exercises across both sports produce a working AI report.

---

### Phase 6 — Leaderboard & Verification

- Leaderboard populated from `leaderboard_view` (athletes ranked by AI score per sport/exercise)
- Official flow: browse athlete list → open report → review video + score → click Verify → badge appears
- Shortlist action connected to `shortlists` table

**Exit Criteria:** Leaderboard shows real scores; officials can verify and shortlist; badge shows on athlete side.

---

### Phase 7 — Notifications

- Push notification triggered on: report ready, official verified, shortlisted
- In-app notification list UI
- Mark-as-read action

**Exit Criteria:** User gets notified on key events without manual refresh.

---

### Phase 8 — Admin Analytics

- Admin dashboard with live platform metrics:
  - Total athlete sign-ups
  - Total videos analyzed
  - Average time-to-report
  - Total athletes shortlisted
- Basic user management (view/manage athletes and officials)

**Exit Criteria:** Admin dashboard reflects live, real platform data.

---

### Phase 9 — Polish, Error Handling & Low-Bandwidth Pass

- Apply error handling standards across all FastAPI endpoints
- Test on low-end Android device with throttled network
- Verify Cloudinary compression + async upload UX holds up
- Edge case sweep: corrupted video, wrong exercise, no person in frame, network drop mid-upload

**Exit Criteria:** App does not break on bad input. Feels usable on a slow/weak connection.

---

### Phase 10 — Demo Prep

- Seed realistic demo data: sample athletes, videos, pre-scored assessments as backup
- Rehearse full user journey: athlete uploads → AI scores → official verifies → leaderboard updates
- Prepare pitch narrative connecting to PRD vision (rural access, democratization)

**Exit Criteria:** Team can demo the full loop confidently in under 5 minutes.

---

### Crunch Mode Guidance

> If time is critically short, protect **Phase 4 (one working AI pipeline end-to-end)** above everything else. A single exercise that genuinely works is far stronger than six exercises that are all half-broken. Cut Phase 8 (Admin Analytics) and trim Phase 7 (Notifications) first if forced.

---

## 14. Non-Functional Requirements

| NFR | Requirement | How Architecture Delivers It |
|-----|------------|------------------------------|
| **Reliability** | Consistent uptime; AI processing produces dependable results | FastAPI async processing; explicit video status tracking (pending → processing → completed / failed); failures caught and surfaced, never silently swallowed |
| **Privacy** | Athlete video and personal data protected; access controls enforced per role | Supabase Row-Level Security — database-level enforcement; athletes cannot access each other's data even if an API route is misconfigured |
| **Security** | Secure auth, data storage, and transmission | Supabase Auth JWT on every API request; HTTPS-only; secrets in .env only; no raw stack traces returned to clients |
| **Scalability** | Architecture must accommodate a growing user base | AI module isolated in `services/ai/` — extractable into standalone microservice; stateless FastAPI backend scales horizontally; Cloudinary CDN scales without code changes |
| **Rural / Low-End Compatibility** | Lightweight app on low-bandwidth networks and low-spec Android devices | Cloudinary auto-compression + CDN; async upload with status polling (UI never blocks); lean Expo bundle; no in-app video recording |

---

## 15. Security, Privacy & Development Rules

### 15.1 Tech Stack Discipline
- Stack is **locked** per Architecture.md: React Native (Expo) / FastAPI / Supabase Postgres / Cloudinary / MediaPipe
- No library swaps without explicit team approval
- No new architectural patterns (Redux, ORMs, message queues) without prior discussion

### 15.2 Secret & Config Management
- All API keys and credentials live in `.env` — **never hardcoded**, even temporarily
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` from commit #1 — **never committed**
- No printing secrets to console for debugging

### 15.3 Database & Schema Integrity
- **No schema changes** (new tables, columns, renamed fields) without first surfacing the exact SQL/migration
- No silent field renaming that other code depends on
- RLS policies are **never disabled** "to make testing easier" — this is a security regression
- No direct production DB writes during testing — use dev/staging

### 15.4 API Contract Stability
- Once an endpoint's request/response shape is defined and frontend is built against it, backend cannot silently change it
- Frontend and backend shape changes are always coordinated and co-deployed

### 15.5 AI Pipeline Code Rules
- AI/CV logic stays isolated in `services/ai/` — **never inlined into route handlers**
- Every placeholder/stub is marked `# TODO:` and called out explicitly — no fake-complete code
- Ambiguous business logic (e.g. "what counts as a valid push-up rep") has stated assumptions — never silently chosen

### 15.6 Error Handling Standards
- Consistent error response shape from FastAPI:
```json
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "VIDEO_PROCESSING_FAILED", "message": "Could not detect a person in the video." } }
```
- Correct HTTP status codes — no returning 500 for everything
- AI pipeline failures (no person detected, corrupted file, wrong exercise) are **expected failures**, not bugs — mark video `failed` with a human-readable reason
- One global exception handler catches anything unhandled — never leak a raw Python stack trace to the client
- Validate uploads **before** running AI — file type, duration, size cap — reject early

### 15.7 Git Discipline
- Never commit video files or large binary assets
- Never commit `.env`
- Meaningful commit messages — no "fix stuff" or "update" (judges review commit history)

---

## 16. Success Metrics

ATHLETIX tracks four core success metrics visible on the Admin Dashboard:

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Athlete Sign-ups** | Total registered athletes | Platform adoption — are we reaching the target users? |
| **Average Time-to-Report** | Time from video upload to AI assessment delivery | AI pipeline efficiency — faster = better UX = more athlete trust |
| **Videos Analyzed** | Total AI assessments completed | Platform usage depth — are athletes submitting and getting assessed? |
| **Athletes Shortlisted** | Total unique athletes shortlisted by officials | Platform outcome — are we actually enabling talent discovery? |

---

## 17. AI Model Strategy

### Why We Don't Train From Scratch

Training a pose estimation model from scratch requires:
- Massive labeled video datasets (hundreds of thousands of examples)
- Weeks of GPU compute time
- Deep ML research expertise in video understanding

This is a **solved problem** with open, production-grade solutions.

### Our Approach: Stand on Giants, Build on Top

```
Layer 1 — Solved, Use Pre-trained
    MediaPipe BlazePose
    - 33 body landmark keypoints per frame
    - Trained on millions of samples
    - Runs fast in Python server-side
    - NOT reinvented

             +

Layer 2 — Our IP, Custom Built
    Sport-specific Assessment Module
    - Per-exercise metric extraction
      (joint angle thresholds, ROM checks, rep state machines)
    - Custom scoring engine (weighted rule-based)
    - Strength/weakness detection
    - Actionable suggestion generation
    - THIS is ATHLETIX's core IP
```

**Optional enhancement (if time permits):** Fine-tune a lightweight classifier on joint-angle/keypoint sequences using a small custom-labeled dataset for improved form-quality scoring beyond rule-based thresholds.

This positions the team's value-add in the **sports-specific assessment layer** — the domain knowledge — not in reinventing solved computer vision fundamentals. A stronger and more honest hackathon narrative.

### 4. Database Setup (Supabase)

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the table creation SQL from Section 10 in the Supabase SQL editor
3. Apply RLS policies per the policy table in Section 10.3
4. Enable Authentication with Email provider
5. Copy your project URL and anon key to `.env`

---

## 20. Environment Variables

### Backend `.env`

```env
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# App
APP_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-for-internal-signing
```

### Frontend `.env`

```env
# API
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

# Supabase (anon key only — never service role key in frontend)
